# AHP_Matrix_Analysis
Language: MatLab


Inputs: 

        1. Relative Preference (RP) Matrix of proposed solutions with respect to each objective

        2. Relative Importance (RI) Matrix of one objective against the other objectives
        
Outputs: 

         1. Normalized RP matrix with overall preference

         2. Normalized RI matrix with overall preference
         
         3. Solution value for each solution
         
         4. (If time permitted) consistency index of RP/RI matrix
