# AHP_Matrix_Analysis
Language: MatLab


Inputs:

        1. Relative Preference (RP) Matrix of proposed solutions with respect to each objective

        2. Relative Importance (RI) Matrix of one objective against the other objectives

Outputs:

         1. Normalized RP matrix with overall preference (func: column_normalize.m)

         2. Normalized RI matrix with overall preference (func: column_normalize.m)

         3. Decision value for each solution (func: decision_value.m)

         4. Consistency index of RP/RI matrix (func: consistency_index.m)
